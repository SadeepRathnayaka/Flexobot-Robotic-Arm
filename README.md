## 3D Model Design
The robotic arm was designed in SolidWorks. The design process focused on achieving precision, durability, and smooth motion across all six degrees of freedom. Below are key highlights:

- **Joints and Axes**: The arm includes six rotational joints, allowing a wide range of motion.
- **Actuators**: Powered by three MG996R and three MG90S servo motors.

Key Features:
- Modular assembly for easy maintenance.
- Custom-designed brackets and holders for servos and sensors.
- Compact and efficient design to minimize weight and maximize stability.

## ROS2 Framework Configuration
The robotic arm was integrated with ROS2, enabling advanced robotic functionalities. Some key features include:

### 1. Flexobot Description Package
- **URDF File Creation**: Designed a URDF file using SolidWorks for accurate representation of the robotic arm. ![URDF Design](images/urdf_design.png)
- **RViz Visualization**: Created RViz2 visualization with Joint State Publisher GUI for real-time visualization. [Video](videos/rviz2_visualization.mp4)

### 2. Flexobot Control Package
- **Joint Trajectory Controller**: Configured the joint trajectory controller in the ROS2 control system for both the robotic arm and the gripper.

## Joystick Control
A joystick controller provides an intuitive way to operate the robotic arm in real-time. Features include:

- Mapping of joystick axes to joint movements.
- Adjustable speed control for precise operations. (TODO)

## Hardware Testing
The fully assembled robotic arm is currently in the testing phase. Key focus areas include:

- **Actuator Calibration**: Verifying servo motor functionality and ensuring precise joint control.
- **Stability Testing**: Assessing the armâ€™s ability to maintain stable poses under load.
- **Real-World Validation**: Testing the integration of ROS2 and MoveIt2 configurations with the physical hardware.
- **Joystick Control Validation**: Ensuring smooth and intuitive real-time control of the arm via the joystick.

Preliminary results indicate smooth motion and accurate path execution. However, fine-tuning is ongoing to optimize performance and reliability.
